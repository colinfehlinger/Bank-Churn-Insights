I built a decision-tree classifier after completing Temple Universityâ€™s Data Analytics course to predict bank customer churn. Using a CSV dataset of customer records, the model classifies churn risk from features including gender, credit score, geography, age, number of products, and account balance. The output highlights at-risk segments and informs targeted retention strategies.
